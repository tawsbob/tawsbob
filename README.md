Overload

Every scratch just reminds me of what I’m trying to conceal. The more I fix it, the more it looks worn.  
I can’t be an angel with this rusted halo. Bleach-stained fingers can’t erase the shadow.  
If I’m counting by the scars, then let scars show. Hey, I’m human — I’m broken, but I won’t let go… I won’t let go!

I’m alive, still worth my soul.
